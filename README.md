# HYPOTHYROIDISM PREDICTIVE MODEL.
The health sector in Kenya continues to embrace technological methods of diagnosing illnesses in patients. Machine learning methods, used to diagnose disease are being developed in our hospitals.

This project is a case scenario of machine learning being used to solve health problems. A machine learning classification model, will be trained and deployed to predict whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism.

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Aimof the project is to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
